      NGO Darpan Portal is a platform, wherein Non-Profit Organizations (NPOs), can register themselves to obtain a Unique Identity Number. This number is mandatory for all NPOs who are seeking grants from the Ministries/Departments of Government of India. As per the prevention of Money Laundering (Maintenance of Records) Amendment Rules, 2023, all financial institutes have been mandated to ensure NGO Darpan Unique ID for NPOs for opening and operating accounts in any Bank. Similarly, Darpan Unique ID is also required for registration/renewal of FCRA, seeking tax exemptions under 80-G of Income Tax.

    <p class="about-details">
      A non-governmental organization (NGO) is a non-profit entity that operates independently of government influence and aims to address social, cultural, environmental, or economic issues. NGOs play a vital role in society by advocating for human rights, providing disaster relief, promoting healthcare, supporting education, and addressing environmental concerns, among many other initiatives. They are often funded through donations, grants, and voluntary support and are accountable to the communities they serve rather than government entities. Operating at local, national, or international levels, NGOs work to influence public policy, raise awareness, and foster community development. They often collaborate with governments, other NGOs, and private organizations to maximize their impact. NGOs are unique in their ability to adapt quickly to changing needs, and their independence allows them to advocate for marginalized voices and drive innovation in social services and community support. Their work fosters inclusivity, equality, and sustainable development, contributing significantly to the welfare and empowerment of societies globally.</p>
